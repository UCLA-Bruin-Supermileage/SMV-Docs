We compete in the Shell Eco-marathon Americas competition, where we are challenged to design, build, and race the most fuel-efficient vehicles. We strive to push the boundaries of what is technically possible, giving students invaluable experience and real world engineering skills. With a focus on improving energy efficiency, we help reduce the harmful environmental effects of gasoline combustion.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/part-1-intro":{"id":"networking/part-1-intro","title":"The Principles","description":"If you\'re reading this page then you\'re here for a zero to hero tutorial about networking that will allow you to understand everything that we do here in the DAQ team. This page in particular is meant for those who have little to no experience in computer networking. Let\'s jump right in!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/part-2-ethernet":{"id":"networking/part-2-ethernet","title":"The Ethernet Protocol","description":"In this page we expand on what we learned in the previous page. Before reading this page I expect you understand that all networked computers (their NICs) have a unique ID imprinted on them from the factory called a MAC address. That\'s literally it, sorry you had to read all that before if you did, but it\'s good to understand the fundamentals. Let\'s get to it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/part-3-ip":{"id":"networking/part-3-ip","title":"The IP Protocol","description":"Ok, if you didn\'t absorb anything from the previous 2 pages, then now is the time to lock in and start remembering. IP is all around us, it is used to view this web page, to send messages, and to do pretty much anything on the internet. All of the lower level protocols like ethernet, and the physical connectors get abstracted and we mainly refer to connectivity using the IP protocol.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/part-4-checkpoint":{"id":"networking/part-4-checkpoint","title":"Changing Perspectives","description":"So in the past few pages I took the approach from the bottom up, going from one computer to a whole universe of computers. To be completely honest it\'s hard to follow because all of the topics have so many branches and sub topics that I just had to make sacrifices and assumptions about what to discuss. So, with this checkpoint page, I\'m going to sort of repeat what I\'ve said before, but from a completely different frame of mind.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"networking/part-5-serverside":{"id":"networking/part-5-serverside","title":"Server Side Shenanigans","description":"Wow it\'s been a lot of writing so far, if you\'ve been reading sequentially, pat yourself on the back because even I\'m exhausted and I\'m the one ranting about all of it.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
