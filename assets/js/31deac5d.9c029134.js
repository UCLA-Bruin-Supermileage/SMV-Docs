Closest to you are your local DNS servers (remember what local means) and farthest from you are the top level domain (TLD) servers. When you first make that request to SMV (I'm going to use SMV as shorthand for the full URL) what happens is that it goes to your local DNS server provided by your DHCP server. If your local DNS has it, then it responds with the corresponding IP address. If it doesn't, then it will forward the request to the next DNS server up the pipeline (usually your ISP).
