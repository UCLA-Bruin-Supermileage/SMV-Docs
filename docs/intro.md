# We are Bruin Supermileage
Bruin Supermileage designs and builds a hydrogen-powered vehicle each year to compete in the Shell Eco-marathon Americas. We strive to push the boundaries of what is technically possible, giving students invaluable experience and real world engineering skills. With a focus on improving energy efficiency, we help reduce the harmful environmental effects of gasoline combustion.
